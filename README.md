# NLP-tutorials
Minimal NLP implementations to understand them from the ground up. Why this when there are thousand other tutorials and huggingface? Too many abstractions, man, stuff is super complicated. I just want to see a documented piece of code and get the idea in like 1 min. So this is attempt to do that. 

Disclaimer: All of this is purely for educational purposes. Feel free to do whatever you want with them or if you care enough to improve them, I am happy. All this is still work in progress btw.
